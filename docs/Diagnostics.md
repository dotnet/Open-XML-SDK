# OOXML0001 - IPackage related APIs are currently experimental

As of v3.0, a new abstraction layer was added in between `System.IO.Packaging` and `DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Packaging.OpenXmlPackage`. This is currently experimental, but can be used if needed. This will be stabalized in a future release, and may or may not require code changes.
