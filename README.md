Open-XML-SDK
============

Release Version 2.6.1

    News: The Office2016 branch on this repo contains a preview of the Open-Xml-Sdk v3.0, which
	supports the Office 2016 extensions in the file format.  The biggest change to the markup was
	the introduction of the ExtendedChartPart, which support the new chart types, such as Waterfall,
	Box and Whisker, and Sunburst.  You can specify FileFormatVersions.Office2016 to validate this
	markup.  This version of the SDK also supports using the strongly-typed OM to access the markup
	in the new parts.
	
	We will merge the Office2016 branch into vNext at some point in the future, after receiving
	feedback.

The Open XML SDK provides open-source libraries for working with Open XML
Documents (DOCX, XLSX, and PPTX).  It supports scenarios such as:
- High-performance generation of word-processing documents, spreadsheets, and presentations.
- Populating content in DOCX files from an XML data source.
- Splitting up (shredding) a DOCX or PPTX file into multiple files, and combining
  multiple DOCX / PPTX files into a single file.
- High fidelity conversion of DOCX => HTML/CSS and HTML/CSS => DOCX.
- Extraction of data from XLSX.
- Searching and replacing content in DOCX / PPTX using regular expressions.
- Updating cached data and embedded spreadsheets for charts in DOCX / PPTX.
- Document modification, such as removing tracked revisions or removing
  unacceptable content from documents.

[Open-Xml-PowerTools](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Open-Xml-PowerTools) provides example code and guidance for implementing many of the above important Open XML scenarios.  Be sure to check it out
before re-inventing your own solutions.

The Open-Xml-Sdk relies on the System.IO.Packaging namespace.  There is an implementation of System.IO.Packaging in the WindowsBase assembly,
and there is a new, open source implementation of System.IO.Packaging that is included with version 2.6 of the Open-Xml-Sdk.  Because of this, there
are six projects in the Visual Studio solution.  [This screen-cast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B13IYHKhcc8) describes the six projects, and explains
the purpose behind each.

News
====
The most recent release of the Open XML SDK is Version 2.6.1, which includes a total of 1333 XUnit tests.

We are also happy to announce the release of Open-Xml-PowerTools on GitHub.  Open-Xml-PowerTools provides
example code and guidance for implementing a wide range of Open XML scenarios.  You can find PowerTools
for Open XML, which previously lived at [PowerTools.CodePlex.com](http://powertools.codeplex.com) at
[github.com/OfficeDev/Open-Xml-PowerTools](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Open-Xml-PowerTools).

Change Log
==========

Moved to `RELEASE_NOTES.md`

Going forward, the Open XML SDK will be based on this new implementation of System.IO.Packaging.

Documentation
=============

The functionality of the specific classes in Open XML SDK Version 2.6.0 is the same as for version 2.5, therefore
the documentation available on MSDN is still accurate.

[Open XML SDK 2.5 for Office](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/bb448854.aspx)

In addition to open sourcing of the SDK, Microsoft has opened up the
conceptual documentation for public review / contributions.  A copy of
the documentation is [now in GitHub](https://github.com/OfficeDev/office-content) for you to edit and review.

Build Instructions
==================

Note: for this first release, you must have some version of Visual Studio
installed.  Visual Studio 2015 Community Edition will work just fine:
https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/downloads/download-visual-studio-vs

To build the Open XML SDK:
- Clone the repo at https://github.com/OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK
- Open the solution using Visual Studio 2013 or 2015.  Community Edition of VS2015 works just fine.
- Build the solution (using either Debug or Release configuration)
- Run the Xunit tests to verify the installation

If you want to use a command line approach:
- Start a Visual Studio command prompt, and change into the directory that contains the repo
- Use MSBUILD to build the SDK  (C:> MSBUILD Open-Xml-Sdk.sln)
- You can also use MSBUILD to build the individual projects.

To use the SDK:
- In your program that uses the Open XML SDK, add references to the newly built libraries in DocumentFormat.OpenXml/bin/Debug (or in DocumentFormat.OpenXml/bin/Release)

Previously, we were using PowerShell to generate a new version number for each build.  This is no longer required, and it is more convenient to build the SDK using MSBUILD, therefore I have removed the instructions for building using the PowerShell script.

Building with Mono
=================
- First, ensure you have mono installed in a manner appropriate to your linux/unix distribution.
- `make -f Makefile-Linux-Mono build`
- Find libraries in the folder: ./build/OpenXmlSdkLib
- [Screen-Cast: Using the Open XML SDK on Linux using Mono](http://openxmldeveloper.org/blog/b/openxmldeveloper/archive/2014/07/03/screen-cast-using-open-xml-sdk-on-linux-using-mono.aspx)
