Open XML SDK
============

> NOTICE: 
> 
> The next minor release (v2.20.0) will be limited in scope and focused on obsoleting types that will be removed in v3.0.0. This should provide a stepping stone for migrating to v3.0.0. This will occur in the `release/v2.20.0` branch.
> 
> v3.0.0 will refactor a number of things to address some technical debt, with the goal being to retain (as much as possible) source compatibility. This means, we hope to maintain things such that you can update your package and recompile with limited changes. However, binary compatibility will not be a goal and will break that for some changes. However, we plan on keeping these documented. PRs that introduce such changes will be marked with a `breaking-change` label and will be added to a list to help migrating to v3.0.0. These changes will occur on the `main` branch.
>
> Please see the [v3.0.0 milestone](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK/milestone/1) for issues and PRs that are included in this change. For discussions about this change, please join us at [this issue](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK/issues/1270).

The Open XML SDK provides tools for working with Office Word, Excel, and PowerPoint documents. It supports scenarios such as:

- High-performance generation of word-processing documents, spreadsheets, and presentations.
- Document modification, such as adding, updating, and removing content and metadata.
- Search and replace content using regular expressions.
- Splitting up (shredding) a file into multiple files, and combining multiple files into a single file.
- Updating cached data and embedded spreadsheets for charts in Word/PowerPoint.

# Packages

The official release NuGet packages for Open XML SDK are on NuGet.org:

| Package | Download |
|---------|----------|
| DocumentFormat.OpenXml | [![NuGet](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/DocumentFormat.OpenXml.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/DocumentFormat.OpenXml) |
| DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Linq | [![NuGet](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Linq.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Linq) |
| DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Features | [![NuGet](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Features.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Features) |

## Daily Builds

The NuGet package for the latest builds of the Open XML SDK is available as a custom feed on an Azure blob. Stable releases here will be mirrored onto NuGet and will be identical. You must set up a [NuGet.config](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/reference/nuget-config-file) file that looks similar to this:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<configuration>
  <packageSources>
    <add key="OpenXmlCI" value="https://openxmlsdk.blob.core.windows.net/feed/index.json" />
  </packageSources>
</configuration>
```

For latests changes, please see the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md)

## Framework Support

The package currently supports the following frameworks:

- .NET Framework 3.5+
- .NET Standard 1.3+
- .NET Core 1.0+
- .NET 5+
- Mono 4.6+
- Xamarin.iOS 10.0+
- Xamarin.Mac 3.0+
- Xamarin.Android 7.0+
- UWP 10.0+
- Unity 2018.1+

# Known Issues

- On .NET Core and .NET 5, zip packages do not have a way to stream data. Thus, the working set can explode in certain situations. This is a [known issue](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/1544).
- On .NET Core, targeting .NET Framework 4.5+, and .NET 5, `System.Uri` will not parse invalid links. This causes an exception. A workaround in v2.12.0+ of OpenXml SDK is to use `OpenSettings.RelationshipErrorRewriter` to rewrite them to something that can be parsed. A discussion is available [here](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/26084) to enable something more robust in `System.IO.Packaging`.
- On .NET Framework, an `IsolatedStorageException` may be thrown under certain circumstances. This generally occurs when manipulating a large document in an environment with an AppDomain that does not have enough evidence. A sample with a workaround is available [here](/samples/IsolatedStorageExceptionWorkaround).

# Documentation

The functionality of the specific classes in this version of the Open XML SDK is similar to version 2.5, therefore the [Open XML SDK 2.5 for Office](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/bb448854.aspx) documentation available on MSDN is still accurate.

In addition to open sourcing of the SDK, Microsoft has opened up the conceptual documentation for public review / contributions.  A copy of the documentation is  available for you to edit and review [in GitHub](https://github.com/OfficeDev/office-content).
