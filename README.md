Open-XML-SDK
============
The Open XML SDK provides open-source libraries for working with Open XML
Documents (DOCX, XLSX, and PPTX).  It supports scenarios such as:
- High-performance generation of word-processing documents, spreadsheets,
  and presentations
- Document modification, such as removing tracked revisions or removing
  unacceptable content from documents
- Data and content querying and extraction, such as transformation from
  DOCX to HTML, or extraction of data from spreadsheets

Documentation
=============

This release of the SDK is the exact source code for version 2.5, therefore
the documentation available on MSDN is still accurate.

[Open XML SDK 2.5 for Office](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/bb448854.aspx)

In addition to open sourcing of the SDK, Microsoft has opened up the
conceptual documentation for public review / contributions.  A copy of
the documentation is [now in GitHub](https://github.com/OfficeDev/office-content) for you to edit and review.
