2. Ensure backend is building successfully (it verifies that all data we expect is present in the SDK)
3. Create release (tag)
4. Create [AzDo Release](https://office.visualstudio.com/OC/_release?_a=releases&view=mine&definitionId=231) to push to NuGet.org
5. Update `PackageValidationBaselineVersion` [here](src/Directory.Build.targets) to new version for backwards compatibility checks
