      This is a code generator and would not need multiple targets. However, due to the build matrix on
      the CI system, there are times when this project will need to be built supporting a .NET 3.5 target.

      To simplify this, only builds targeting .NET 5.0 will actually have any code and on other targets
      will be a no-op.
