# DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Framework

Low-level infrastructure and shared primitives used by the Open XML SDK libraries.

Most consumers should reference `DocumentFormat.OpenXml` (and optionally `DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Linq`) directly. This package is intended primarily for advanced scenarios and library authors extending the SDK.

## Getting started

Typical usage is indirect, via `DocumentFormat.OpenXml` types such as `OpenXmlElement`, `OpenXmlPart`, and related infrastructure.
